## Extension Settings

1. Add a Finnhub API key first for stock ticker information access in Preference/vscode-stock-watcher.FinnhubApiKey. A free key can be aquired here -> https://finnhub.io/.
2. Add your followed stock tickers in Preference/vscode-stock-watcher.stockSymbols.   


(Note: Finnhub free API is rated limited at 30 calls/minute, if you need more than 30 calls/minute get off VsCode and get yourself a bloomberg terminal :))
